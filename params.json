An isolated word often has no direct and needs to be surrounded by other words to carry meaning.\r\n\r\n2. Our ultimate goal isn’t to know X words, it’s to be able to string them together to express ideas and thoughts in sentences and conversation.\r\n\r\n3. We remember things better when they form connections with other memories or concepts. You’ll remember words more effectively when they are used in an interesting or emotionally charged context.\r\n\r\n4. The top 1,000 words from one particular list may not be the ideal 1,000 words for you to learn. A backpacker will need a different set than a businessman.\r\n\r\n5. A list this long is too intimidating to memorise without a good strategy.\r\n\r\nLuckily, there’s a solution: read interesting content relevant to you. This appears to fix all these problems. You will encounter the most useful words more frequently, and they will be charged with interesting contexts and meaning. But reading is difficult without the necessary vocabulary.\r\n\r\n[SRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRS) is an effective way to memorize a large quantity of things, and is very suited for learning vocabulary.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Awesome list of resources and tools for learning English\r\n\r\n### SRS apps and websites\r\n\r\n- [Readlang](http://readlang.com)\r\n\r\n- [Flashcards Deluxe](http://orangeorapple.com/Flashcards/) (Mobile platforms only)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Listening\r\n- Podcasts\r\n  - [Luke's English Podcast](http://teacherluke.co.uk)  (B1+)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Learn English with Videos <sup>[*][1]</sup>\r\n\r\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/?gl=GB) <sup>[*][2] | [*][3]</sup>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Speaking and Communication\r\n\r\n- [iTalki](https://www.italki.com)\r\n- [HelloTalk](http://www.hellotalk.com)  (Mobile platforms only)\r\n\r\n\r\n(more tomorrow)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Lisence\r\n\r\n[![CC0](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/buttons/88x31/svg/cc-zero.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\r\n\r\nTo the extent possible under law, [Oleh Sliusar](http://olehsliusar.com) has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this work.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-a-foreign-language-using-YouTube/answer/Oleh-Sliusar?srid=upjL5 \"How To Learn With The Videos\"\r\n[2]: https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-YouTube-channels-to-learn-English-language/answer/Oleh-Sliusar?srid=upjL5 \"What are good YouTube channels to learn English language?\"\r\n[3]: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-filter-English-only-results-when-searching-on-Youtube/answer/Oleh-Sliusar?srid=upjL5 \"How to set English as a default language on YouTube\"\r\n",
